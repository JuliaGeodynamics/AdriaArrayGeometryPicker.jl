The AdA Picker is a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to facilitate the visualization and comparison of geophysical datasets. The name stems from the [*AdriaArray*](https://orfeus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/adria_array_main.html) initiative, which focuses on the Adria region. This GUI is being developed as part of the DFG funded Priority Program DEFORM under project number TH 2076/10-1.

The AdA Picker employs [GLMakie](https://docs.makie.org/stable/explanations/backends/glmakie.html) for high-performance graphics rendering. It builds on [GeophysicalModelGenerator.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeodynamics/GeophysicalModelGenerator.jl) for data handling. To use the AdA Picker, it is therefore necessary to be familiar with GeophysicalModelGenerator.jl.
